# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.

## About This Website

This website features a retro **DOS terminal style** design, inspired by early command-line interfaces. I've built this nostalgic-style site using modern technologies:

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Fast build tool
- **GitHub Pages** - Static site hosting

## Why This Style?

In today's web world full of fancy animations and complex interactions, I wanted to create something **simple and unique**:

- **Content-focused** - No distracting elements
- **Fast loading** - Minimal design means faster load times
- **Nostalgic** - A tribute to the early computing era

## How to Use This Website

You can navigate in two ways:

1. **Command Line** - Type commands directly, like `/blog`, `/about`
2. **Menu Navigation** - Click the top menu buttons
