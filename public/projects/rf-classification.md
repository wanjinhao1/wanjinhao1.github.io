# RF Signal Classification with Deep Learning

Research project on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) detection using deep learning techniques for RF signal categorization and identification.

## Overview

This project focuses on developing deep learning models to automatically classify and identify RF signals, with a specific application to UAV detection and recognition.

## Research Areas

### Signal Categorization
- **Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC)**
- **Signal type identification**
- **Waveform recognition**

### UAV Detection
- **RF fingerprinting** for drone identification
- **Signal-of-interest detection**
- **Trajectory estimation via RF analysis

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: RF spectrum measurements using software-defined radios (SDR)
2. **Preprocessing**: Time-frequency analysis, feature extraction
3. **Model Development**: CNN, ResNet, and Transformer-based architectures
4. **Evaluation**: Classification accuracy, robustness to noise

## Tech Stack

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework
- **TensorFlow** - Alternative framework for experiments
- **NumPy/SciPy** - Signal processing
- **Matplotlib** - Visualization
