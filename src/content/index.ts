I am a developer, and this is my DOS-style personal homepage.

You can:
- Use the top menu bar for quick navigation
- Type commands directly (e.g., \`/about\`)
- Type \`/help\` to see all available commands

**Note**: This is a DOS terminal-style website where all content can be accessed through commands.

# About Me

Hello! I'm Wang Jinhao, a developer passionate about technology.

## Introduction
I focus on front-end development and user experience design. I love exploring new technologies and building interesting projects.

This DOS-style personal homepage is my tribute to retro terminal aesthetics, while also showcasing my technical skills.

## Why DOS Style?
- **Minimal**: Focus on content itself
- **Efficient**: Command-line interaction is fast and direct
- **Nostalgic**: A tribute to the early era of computing

Hope you enjoy this unique browsing experience!
