This is Jinhao Wan, and welcom to my personal homepage. Now I am working in ZJUT as a PHD student. I am interested in "deep learning for signal Categorization/Identification" and "RF detection of UAVs".

You can find my typical papers, projects, skills, and contact information here.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me (-> wanjinhao1@gmail.com <-) or leave a message. 


You can:
- Use the top menu bar for quick navigation
- Type commands directly (e.g., \`/about\`)
- Type \`/help\` to see all available commands
